# SolarSystem
This is my Solar System project, the main aim of which is to learn C++.


The program is written in C++, the aim is to create a simulation of the solar system using the Semi-Implicit Euler Method and the Gravitational Equations of motion. It was written using Visual Studio 2017.

The simulation loops over a number of time steps, for each timestep the gravitational accelerations on each planet is calculated and then the position and velocity of the planets are updated.

The program outputs a text file with the X and Y positions of each of the planets in tab separated columns which can then be plotted in the software of your choice.


## Learning outcomes

* C++: Logic control, printing to console, conditionals, loops, file input/output and preprocessor directives.
* Object Oriented Programming: Classes and objects, contstructors and destructors, getters and setters, friend classes and inheritance.
* TDD: Writing unit tests and designing code to be more testable.
* Github: Pushing and pulling to remote, committing changes, using from command-line and branches.
