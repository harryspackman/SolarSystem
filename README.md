# SolarSystem
This is my Solar System project, the main aim of which is to learn C++.


The program is written in C++, the aim is to create a simulation of the solar system using the Semi-Implicit Euler Method and the Gravitational Equations of motion. It was written using Visual Studio 2017.

The simulation loops over a number of time steps, for each timestep the gravitational accelerations on each planet is calculated and then the position and velocity of the planets are updated.

The program outputs a text file with the X and Y positions of each of the planets which can then be plotted in the software of your choice.
